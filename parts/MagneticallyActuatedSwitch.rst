Magnetically Actuated Switch
============================
The magnetically actuated switch (MAS) is a switch that relies on magnet's magnetic field to sense the presence of something. The one that we use, in particular, is made by McMaster-Carr and is model **65985K312**.

From the McMaster-Carr website:

  These switches actuate when a magnet comes within sensing distance, and reset when the magnet moves away. Theyâ€™re often used to detect when a door or window    opens. Mount the switch in a stationary position, such as a door frame, and mount the magnet to a movable object, such as the door.

Wiring
-------
The MAS has 3 leads: power, ground, and a data lead. The power and ground are plugged in to the PDH, and the data lead goes into a DIO port on the RoboRIO.
