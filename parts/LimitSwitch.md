![Using Limit Switches to Control Behavior — FIRST Robotics Competition  documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/2020/_images/image13.png)

Limit switches are a type of sensor commonly used in FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) to detect the physical position or limit of a mechanism or component. They are typically wired to the robot's control system, such as the RoboRIO or a motor controller, and provide a digital input signal indicating whether the switch is open or closed.

Wiring
--------------- 
1.  Connect the power, ground and signal wires onto the RoboRIO 

2.  Make sure to connect the signal wire into DIO, as it is an On & Off Switch
