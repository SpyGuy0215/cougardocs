Ultrasonic Sensor 
==============
![Ultrasonics - Hardware — FIRST Robotics Competition documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/_images/mb-lv-ez1-serial.png)
The Ultrasonic sensor is a distance sensor that is able to detect how far something is away from the sensor. This sensor shows real time background automation calibration, real time waveform signature analysis and real time noise rejection algorithm results. it can detect game pieces, while detecting the distance between walls.

Wiring
--------------- 
![Connecting a MB1013 to the analog in port of the roboRIO.](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/_images/ultrasonic-sensor-to-roborio.svg)

1.  Connect the power and ground wires: Connect the power wire of the sensor to the appropriate voltage source on the FRC controller, and the ground wire to the corresponding ground connection.

2.  Connect the signal wire: The signal wire of the ultrasonic sensor is used to transmit the distance measurement data to the FRC controller. Connect this wire to an analog input port on the RoboRIO
