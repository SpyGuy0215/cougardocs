A color sensor is able to detect color to do tasks. It can be especially useful when detecting the difference between a cube and a cone. This specific sensor has a built in Proximity sensor as well, including a light to make sure the robot can see even when it is in dark spaces.

Wiring
--------------- 
1.  Connect the power and ground wires: Connect the power wire of the sensor to the appropriate voltage source on the FRC controller, and the ground wire to the corresponding ground connection.

2.  Connect the signal wire: The signal wire of the ultrasonic sensor is used to transmit the distance measurement data to the FRC controller. Connect this wire to an analog input port on the RoboRIO
