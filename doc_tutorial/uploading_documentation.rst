Step 2: Uploading Documentation
=================================
To get your documentation uploaded to the website, email
**shashankprasanna1@gmail.com** with the files and where you want them to be. Then, 
they can be manually added and show up in `dev` channel, tested, and then merged
into the `latest` channel. Good luck with documentation!

.. note:: 
    We are working on a better upload system, hopefully coming soon!
